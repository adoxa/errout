/*
  Inject code into the target process to load our DLL.	The target thread
  should be suspended on entry; it remains suspended on exit.

  Initially I used the "stack" method of injection.  However, this fails
  when DEP is active, since that doesn't allow code to execute in the stack.
  To overcome this I used the "CreateRemoteThread" method.  However, this
  would fail with Wselect, a program to assist batch files.  Wselect runs,
  but it has no output.  As it turns out, removing the suspended flag would
  make Wselect work, but it caused problems with everything else.  So now I
  allocate a section of memory and change the context to run from there.  At
  first I had an event to signal when the library was loaded, then the memory
  was released.  However, that wouldn't work with -p and CMD.EXE (4NT v8
  worked fine).  Since it's possible the DLL might start a process suspended,
  I've decided to simply keep the memory.
